# OV5640 Autofocus Firmware

This repository contains some C code that converts publicly available variants of the OV5640 autofocus firmware found online to .bin files expected by the Linux kernel.

Already converted .bin files, together with the accompanying .regs files, if any, can be found in the "bin" directory.  The .regs files contain additional register values that were found in the publicly available variants of the OV5640 autofocus firmware.
